## FPGA 

### Downlink Transmitter

Paul KB5MU has a Jupyter Notebook to put together BBFrames for the encoder. It can be found here: https://github.com/phase4ground/adi_adrv9371_zc706/tree/correct-build-errors/tools/ts2bbframes 

We've been working very hard to get the encoder reliably working. There's a lot going on here. Visit #fpga for details. 

### Uplink Receiver

Opulent Voice forward error correction article *has been accepted for publication in QEX*. 

Opulent Voice will be on a sounding rocket in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico. Work is resuming after the hurricane interruption, with students joining #opulent-voice on Slack. 

## Haifuraiya

Article follow-up sent to JAMSAT Editor. Review draft seen - it's going to look great!

Engine thrust measurements expected by January 2023. 

### Power Bus

Power systems, power budget, and power dissipation determinations are in progress. Thank you to Thomas Parry, Michael KA2ZEV, and Samudra for ongoing contributions.

#### Rechargeable Batteries

Battery packs from Nickel Metal Hydride cells will be created. These will be used as the initial battery packs for the engineering model. This work will complete the Cell Matching project. 

#### Solar Panels

Flexible panels from Northrup Grumman will be modeled and quoted.

#### Power Controller
