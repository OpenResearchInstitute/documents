Setting up a Linux VM on Chonc
2021-07-20 Paul Williamson KB5MU

This isn't a complete tutorial, just a set of reminders for myself
on how to set up a new Linux VM of the type we use for FPGA development
at the ORI San Diego remote lab.


Log in to Unraid on the web

Add new VM and fill out the settings

Be in a browser window that doesn't block pop-ups

Click create

When it appears in the VM list, open NoVNC to it

Double-click the install shortcut on the desktop

Follow the prompts

When it says to remove installation media and restart, force stop the VM and remove the Linux ISO from the VM's settings. Restart the VM and refresh the noVNC connection.

Open network settings and set up fixed IP address, etc.

Open a terminal and apt update/upgrade

apt install openssh-server

ssh-keygen -t ed25519

cd /etc/update-motd.d and use chmod -x to disable noisy login messages.

sudo addgroup ori dialout

sudo apt install mesa-utils (support for glxgears)

set up /etc/hosts (copy from ori-west and edit)

sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi

Copy this into ~/.vnc/xstartup
#!/bin/sh 
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
vncconfig -iconic &
gnome-terminal --working-directory=~ &
dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session &

download and install Xilinx tools if needed

set up udev rules for devices if needed

if mapping drives, don't forget to create mount points with mkdir and add lines to /etc/fstab
