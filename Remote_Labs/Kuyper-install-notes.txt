# Kuyper Linux Installation

To create an installation of ADI Kuyper Linux on an SD card
for one of the Xilinx dev boards:

Refer to https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux
https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/adi-kuiper-gen/releases

On macOS, you can just use Balena Etcher to write the SD card.

Don't forget to set the board's DIP switches to boot from SD!

After booting, if the filesystem is smaller than the card you used, say:
raspi-config --expand-rootfs
and reboot.

To assign a static IP address, edit /etc/network/interfaces and add:

interface eth0
static ip_address=10.73.1.9/24
static routers=10.73.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.2.2

Adjust to suit local network. IP address should match a domain name.
Routers should match the remote lab LAN. DNS should match the remote
lab LAN.
