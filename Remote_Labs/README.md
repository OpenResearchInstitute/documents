# ORI Remote Lab

Open Research Institute runs two labs for remote access. The labs provide
capabilities that might be out of reach for most volunteers to purchase for
themselves, such as commercial FPGA development boards and licenses for the
software tools required to make use of them. By sharing these expensive
resources over the Internet, we hope to enable many engineers of various
skill levels to contribute to advanced development of open source projects.
