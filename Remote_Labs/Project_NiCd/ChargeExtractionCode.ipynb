    "# Abstract\n",
    "By utilizing data created by the UBA software, we are able to compare and contrast all of our battery curves after isolating them. Using this comparison, we are able to group each cell into collection of batteries based on the type of cycle used and the number of cycles used and test the quality of the battery. \n",
    "# Methods  \n",
    "## Mathematical Component  \n",
    "   By finding the differences between cycles in the data and comparing the overall sum, we can find the general approximation of difference between two battery cells. Utilizing this, we can apply a grouping method to group the least general difference between cells, then utilize those groups to create our optimized batteries.  \n",
    "# Data Conditioning  \n",

    "## Importing Libraries\n",
    "We will be utilizing `os`, `pandas`, `itertools`, `numpy` and `contextlib`. Run the command `pip3 install pandas` and `pip3 install numpy` if you do not have these modules installed yet.  "

We found that each file contains two identifiable markers that signify the start of the discharge and the start of the long 3 hour equalization charge. We are generally able to tell which file has what amount of cycles because of this. In case we want to utilize later cycles of the batteries, we can only use sixgroup.
